# As of Today
version 0.1

## What It Is
As of Today is a social media site that brings wedding photographers and clients together.  For the soon-to-be-married, searching for a photographer should be about fun and discovery.  Clients can explore the different styles that are available and choose a photographer who suits their interests.

### ...But What It Is Really
I am a recent graduate of a web development immersion course.  This site is an updated version of a project I made.  Additional styling and functionality were added to the current version.  The site currently is simplistic, and hopefully I will be able to add more soon.

- Yelp API integration for photographers
- Separate login for 'clients'
- 'Like' system
- Favoriting photographers, portfolios, and photos
- ...and more!

### Limitations
This site is currently set up for only the photographers to create an account and upload.  (Of course there's no stopping anyone in creating an account)

### Technology Used
- Rails(v 4.1.7)
- MongoDB/Mongoid
- Bootstrap
- CarrierWave
- AWS S3
- Sidekiq (integrated but not in use)
- Notable plugins/gem: Justified Gallery, LoadJs
